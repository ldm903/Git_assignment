> Come, my friends,
>It is not too late to seek a newer world.
>Push off, and sitting well in order smite
>The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
>To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
>Of all the western stars, until I die.
>It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
>It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
>And see the great Achilles, whom we knew,
>Though much is taken, much abides; and though
>We are not now that strength which in ld days
>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are
>One equal temper of heroic hearts,
>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.
>
>Ulysses by Alfred Lord Tennyson
